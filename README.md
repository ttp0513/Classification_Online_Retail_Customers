# Classification_Online_Retail_Customers

<h1> 1. Project Background </h1>

### Overview
- The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii) of this project belongs to a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail company that mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. <br>
- The company has significant amounts of data on its customers's sales data that has been previously underutilized. This project applies KMeans clustering to uncover distinct customer segments based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM). The goal is to support personalized marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
<ul>
  <li> <strong> Data Cleaning & EDA: </strong> Initial preprocessing to ensure that segmentation is based solely on valid, behavior-linked transactions.
  <li> <strong> Outlier Detection: </strong> Isolation of high-value or anomalous customers whose behavior significantly deviates from typical patterns, with recommendations for individualized follow-up or separate analysis. </li> 
  <li> <strong> Customer Segmentation Analysis: </strong> Identification of distinct customer groups using RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized engagement. </li>
</ul>

<h1> 3. Executive Summary </h1>
<h3> Overview of Findings </h3>

Our customer segmentation analysis identified seven distinct groups based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, revealing critical insights into current business performance.

The largest segment, NURTURE, customers with low overall monetary value and limited purchase history but recent activity, comprises nearly half of our customer base. This suggests strong acquisition but low conversion, highlighting a need for targeted onboarding and engagement strategies.

High-value segments such as DELIGHT, REWARD, and PAMPER, though smaller in size, contribute disproportionately to revenue.

<ul><li>DELIGHT: customers with high recency and frequency, and moderate spend. </li>
<li>REWARD: customers with high recency, frequency, and monetary value, </li>
<li>PAMPER: customers with low frequency but high monetary value and recent activity </li></ul>

These groups should be prioritized for retention efforts, VIP experiences, and personalized loyalty strategies to maximize lifetime value.

Meanwhile, the RE-ENGAGE segment shows signs of low engagement and declining activity, presenting a clear opportunity for reactivation campaigns and win-back messaging.

The following sections will provide a deeper breakdown of each customer segment and outline tailored marketing strategies to maximize lifetime value across the portfolio.

Below is the overview visualization of each cluster performance:

<h1> 4. Insights Deep Dive </h1>
<h3> Data Cleaning & EDA </h3>
Before conducting segmentation, I applied rigorous data cleaning to ensure analytical integrity and removed <strong>~23%</strong> of records from the original dataset due to
</ul>
<li> Null Customer IDs, which prevent linkage to individual profiles. </li>
<li> Irrelevant StockCodes, identified through pattern mismatches and business logic.</li>
</ul>
This filtering step improves the quality and interpretability of downstream clustering by removing noise and ensuring all records reflect real customer behavior.

<h3> StockCode Filtering Logic </h3>
StockCodes are usually five-digit numbers (like product IDs), and some valid ones include extra letters at the end. However, there are several codes that don’t represent actual products or customer purchases. These were excluded from the analysis because they don’t reflect real buying behavior and could distort our insights.

<h3> Customer Outliers Detection </h3>

Outliers in Monetary Value and Frequency are visually evident in boxplots, where a small subset of customers exhibit extremely high spend and purchase frequency, compressing the bulk of the data near the lower end. 

These outliers are not discarded, as they represent high-value, highly engaged customers of the client business. Therefore, another separate analysis was conducted to analyze top-tier customers behaviors without distorting the clustering of the broader population.

<h3> Customer Segmentation Analysis </h3>
Seven unique segments were identified, each representing a different stage in the customer lifecycle, from newly acquired to highly loyal.
